# Breathing geometry

A breathing exercise with uniform polyhedra and their spherical geometries.

## Artistic checklist

- [x] sketch the ideas of the scene
- [x] what is the atmosphere?
- [x] color palettes, textures
- [x] smooth breathing animation
- [x] rotation, bobbing, other smooth motions
- [x] ~background image~
- [x] what is the experience that I want to have?

## Technical checklist

- Get a mesh for
    - [x] tetrahedron
    - [x] octahedron
    - [x] cube
    - [x] dodecahedron
    - [x] icosahedron
    - [x] more!
- [x] basic ts config setup
- [x] basic github pages setup
- [x] basic 3d webgl skeleton
- [x] function to triangulate a mesh to the center of faces
- [x] function to subdivide triangular faces to a precision N (powers of 2?)
- [x] function to lerp vertices towards a sphere
- [x] somehow encode the fundamental domains for each mesh
- [x] timer for animation
- [x] ui buttons for mesh selection
- [x] ~render transparently on top of a background image~
